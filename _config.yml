# About Section
# about_title: About Me
about_profile_image: images/profile.jpg
about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  As a Scientific Researcher with 4+ years of experience in Computational Biology and 4+ years experience in experimental Biochemistry, I strive to make biological systems more quantitative, holistic, predictable, and eventually controllable. My enthusiasm for theoretical and experimental biology drives me to be truly discipline-agnostic and to come up with ideas from multiple paradigms to aid my scientific research.

  Things I currently have the most experience with can be broadly classified into: <mark>Biochemistry</mark>, <mark>TIRF Microscopy</mark> and <mark>Computational Biology</mark>. However, I am always eager to explore new ideas and concepts, which helps me grow both personally and professionally. I enjoy staying adaptable and open-minded in the face of new challenges and opportunities.

          Regulating Actin Dynamics and Branched Network Nucleation for Force Generation during Cell Protrusions.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          When cells move, they extend their membranes into flat protrusions, which are formed as a result of forces generated by an orchestrated process that creates a branched network of actin filaments. My goal is to understand the spatial and temporal mechanisms that regulate this process.

          Knowledge-Based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Protein-protein interactions are ubiquitous in cells and are responsible for a variety of biological functions, ranging from signal transduction to force generation. However, experimental methods for predicting interacting surfaces and characterising the whole interactome are time consuming, cost prohibitive, and unscalable. In this project, I designed a computational algorithm for predicting protein-protein interactions.
